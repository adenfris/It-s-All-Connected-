A game of tenuous connections.

Find connections between real-world news articles (courtesy of WikiNews), by finding words that occur between them. You are scored by the minimum count of the two articles - so if one article has 9349 of a word and the other has 3, your score will be three. Only type single lowercase words, or you wonâ€™t get credit.

You, uh, might want to mute the audio after a bit. No reason. This is a professional operation, here, with professional composers.

The web build isn't working ATM, so there's just a windows build right now. I'm working on fixing the web version as we speak.
Here's a list of the sources I used: https://github.com/yambone635/Its-All-Connected/blob/main/Assets/Sources.txt

My GIMP files are in here too, in case you want to see how the sources were altered.

(Note: I had to make a small fix after the end of the submission window to get the builds working - Unity was not including an important file when it made the builds (ugh...). None of the actual code has changed, but I figured it was worth mentioning for transparency's sake.)
